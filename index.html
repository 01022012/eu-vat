<p>On the 1st of January 2015, the VAT place of supply rules will change. This will have huge consequences to all businesses that sell digital products to other countries with the EC. I've outlined what I think the changes will mean in a blog post.</p>

<p>It turns out to be quite tricky to ascertain what the new rules mean for an individual situation. Many of the microbusinesses and freelancers caught up in the change won't have an accountant as their tax affairs were simple until now. While we can't give advice to each other in an official capacity, can we share what we know and what we have been told and try to help each other make sense of these rules.</p>
