        <p>As we all figure out what to do, it would be great if people could write up their implementation experience - either on their own blog or add a page here and link it up. While we can't assume that one business is identical to another, a lot of us are going to be using the same providers and selling the same sorts of products. Can we save each other some legwork by sharing what we have learned?</p>

        <p>Some people have queried whether it is contrary to anti-discrimination laws to refuse to sell to other EU countries. <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090609003228/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file53100.pdf">Sections 33,34,35 of this document</a> suggest that it could be, but not if you could show that costs of registering for VAT/MOSS would put 'excessive strain' on your business.</p>

        <h3>Services</h3>

        <p>As expected a variety of products and services are springing up to take advantage of people needing to comply with this legislation. </p>
        <p>I have not used any of these, so you need to do your own research, but I'll list those I spot here. Some just deal with the VAT aspect for registered businesses, others act as an intermediary, in which case they sell your product and pay you a royalty. You need to satisfy yourself that you are protected if you use any of these services.</p>

        <h4>Services that act as an intermediary</h4>

        <p>If you sell your products via another company then they may take on the VAT responsibility for you. In other words you are giving them the right to sell your product and they pay you a cut of the profit. You should clarify with any third party whether VAT is your responsibility or theirs however if they deal with the VAT then you should not need to be VAT registered yourself. The companies below have confirmed to customers that they do this, or will do by the deadline. If anyone disagrees, please let me know.</p>

        </ul>

        <h4>Other services</h4>

        <p>The below are useful services if you are or plan to be VAT Registered. They can help you gather the proof of customer location, invoice correctly or even submit your MOSS return.</p>
